# Face-Mask-Detection-Based-on-Eigen-Jaw-Method

Similar to the pipeline for face recognition using EigenFace method, we present the detection of presence or absence of face mask based on EigenJaw method. We observe that the system performs satisfactorily on images with single subject, whereas produces high false positives in case of multiple subjects in an image. 

This implementation is a part of proof of principle experiments performed prior to a project proposal presented to Analytic Labs Co Ltd., Bangalore - 560038. We express our heartfelt gratitude to them for providing us with this opportunity.
